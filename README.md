### Project Introduction

I have plodded along computers science for the whole of my life, and this is the first time that horizons of my imagination, of what's possible, have expanded beyond thought. If the lay of the land before you gives you chills, and no matter how foriegn the terms may seem, you get to grasp them word by word; mathematics that seems so complicated at first, starts to unfold its beauty before you; when every page of history seems to witness creation of what was only imagined in realm of dreams, you know that you're moving in direction of great creation. This is how I discover mine. 
Though this is a very basic neural network but I made it from scratch, enamouring myself through every detail and book out there to build this classifier that learns to predict cats. I could've built a classifier for any other object, but this is how I express my love for cats.
